# About Me  

Hi! I'm a passionate developer with expertise in **MERN stack development**, **blockchain**, and **CI/CD practices**. I have a strong interest in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and am working towards mastering DSA to enhance my problem-solving skills.  

With a history of solving **4000+ programming challenges**, I have achieved **top global rankings** and actively contribute to the tech community. As a former **GeeksforGeeks Campus Ambassador**, I enjoyed promoting learning and sharing knowledge.  

Beyond coding, I am committed to open-source projects and enjoy working on innovative ideas, including **blockchain-based ticketing systems** and **Chrome extensions**. I also dedicate time to **charitable causes** for underprivileged individuals, aligning with my goal of making a positive social impact.
